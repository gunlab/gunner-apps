Gunner Apps
=============

> Tactical Programing

----



All The **Apps**, **Scripts**, and ***WebTech*** That I can think of.


Tactical Python
----------------

Python3 is a big builder of [Custom Apps & Programs](#) for **TAC-Slack**.
What it builds I don't know but do know it will probially be built in Python.


### Editing


**Editors**
+ nano
+ Vim
+ mousepad?
+ kate?
+ geany? (NO --gtk based)

Atom and others don't have a command prompt / terminal option. So don't have the
best of chooices on editors. 

It is **Slackware**; *Vim and Terminal* are expected to get top usage.
