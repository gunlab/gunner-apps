----



All The **Apps**, **Scripts**, and **WebTech** That I can think of.



Langs
---------
+ Main
 + Python3
 + Bash/sh
 + JS (web & LPs)
+ Others
 + julia
 + rust
 + curl
 + ruby


Editing
--------

**Editors**
+ nano
+ Vim
+ mousepad?
+ kate?
+ geany? (NO --gtk based)

Atom and others don't have a command prompt / terminal option. So don't have the
best of chooices on editors.

It is **Slackware**; *Vim and Terminal* are expected to get top usage.
