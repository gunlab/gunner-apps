Tactical Python
===============

Python (2.x) is a big builder of [Custom Apps & Programs](#) for **TAC-Slack**.
What it builds I don't know but do know it will probially be built in Python.


Editing
------

**Editors**
+ nano
+ Vim
+ mousepad?
+ kate?
+ geany (NO --gtk based)

Atom and others don't have a command prompt / terminal option. So don't have the
best of chooices on editors. 

It is **Slackware**; Vim and Terminal are expected to get top usage.
